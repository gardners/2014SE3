More Test Plans and Design and Decomposition
============================================

This week we are looking at test plans from a slightly different angle.

Outline a test plan for a substantial real-life system of your choosing.  Some possible examples:
 * baggage handling system for a major airport
 * software for in-car GPS navigation.

Describe how you would approach the design and testing process to ensure success and quality in the result.  
Where are the risks? 
How are you going to address them?

Decompose the problem, think about where the greatest risks are, and how they can be managed first, and probably at a smaller scale, and then progressively assembled using Bottum Up design, Unit Testing and/or other appropriate methodologies, with the goal of proving (or disproving) the feasibility early and at least cost.

Also list (dot point form is fine) what you believe to be:
 * The three most important types of tests;
 * Three types of testing that you think to be much less important.
Justify your reasons.  Consider failure modes and their consequences, and by what method and to what extent it is possible to anticipate and prevent them through the software design and test process.

You might like to read about the failure of the Denver Airport Baggage Handling System (http://calleam.com/WTPF/?page_id=2086) and the Fukoshima Nuclear Disaster (http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22031-fukushima-nuclear-accident-down-to-human-factors.html) to get some ideas about identifying and managing risk (or how not to do those things).

Submit your ~500 word plan as an issue on github in the usual way, clearly marked with the subject "Prac 6" and your FAN.
