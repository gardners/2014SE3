Test Plans
==========

Today you will be doing several things.  

On the one hand, you may be working on finishing up the previous pracs.  You will hopefully also be deciding on (or at least looking at potential) open-source software projects to use as the target for the pracs next term.  

The assessable component for this week will be to write a test plan for either the 2048 program you have been writing, or the software project you intend to use for the pracs next term.

If you haven't read the notes for todays lecture, or watched the lecture, you will probably do well to do at least one of those, as today's lecture discussed a number of the elements that arise in testing and planning to test.

There are lots of online resources that talk about writing test plans.  Some are listed below:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_plan
http://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Test-Plan

You will likely notice that they all offer contradictory instructions.

You will need to decide on your own methodology for this prac.  Considering the material in these and other resources, and the product, i.e., software, you are trying to produce, reason about the kinds of testing that are necessary or appropriate.  

You can just write dot points if you like.  

Then start shaping that into a coherent plan as to how you intend to test the software.

You will want to be convincing me that your plan will adequately test all relevant aspects of the software with a view to the plan being defensible in the (expected to be highly unlikely) that a defect emerges after "delivery" of your program.

I recommend you create the test plan as a plain text or mark-down (.MD) document in the git repository where the program lives (you might need to fork and clone it if you haven't already done so).

Submission will be by creating an issue on my 2014S3 repository with a link to your test plan and repository so that I can read through it.  As with previous checkpoints, if I think further work is required, I will comment on the issue.
