Patches or Enhancements for Existing Open-Source Project
========================================================

This is the competency gate for obtaining High Distinction in this topic.

To pass this gate you will need to craft at least one patch or enhancement to
an existing open-source software project.  Your contribution must be accompanied with
tests that show the defect prior to correction, and that the defect has been corrected
by your patch.  If the project has existing tests, you should demonstrate that all
existing tests still pass after adding your patch.

You must prepare and submit your submission.

Your contributions do not have to be accepted, but we do encourage you to follow
through with the submission process as far as the project will allow.  The experience
and acknowledgement of contributing to a real software project will be invaluable to
you in many ways.

To obtain the checkpoint you must submit an issue that refers to sufficient evidence of the work you have done, and where it has been submitted.
